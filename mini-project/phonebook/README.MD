CHALLENGE 1 => you have been tasked to create a phone book for yourself using python.

REQUIREMENTS:
    - you will be able to add peoples numbers to the phone book
    - you will be able to delete peoples numbers to the phone book
    - you will be able to change peoples numbers to the phone book
    - you will be able to fine peoples numbers to the phone book, by providing a name and getting a number back in return
    
TIPS:
    - think about how you will store the numbers, consider using a dictionary
    - think about how you will structure your code into separate functions

APP FLOW:
    - when you run the application it will:
        - ask you for the action you want to take (e.g. add a number, delete a number, find a number etc)
        - depending on the action you select, it will perform that action and feedback the results to you

CHALLENGE 2 => Data Persistence
    - you have to find a way to use files - it can be a text file or json file to store the phone book contact information
    - you will need to know how to:
        - read a file
        - write to a file
    - you will need to change your logic flow to accommodate for the use of a file

    APP FLOW:
        - when you run the application
        - it will check / load a file that is going to be the store for your contacts
        - when someone adds a contact, it gets added to the file 
        - when the application exits, you should be able to see the person in the file
        - when you run the application again and search for the person - you should be able to fine them 

    additional ask:
        - please add 5 contacts to the pone book file
        - in the session we will use your phone book function to interact with the file
