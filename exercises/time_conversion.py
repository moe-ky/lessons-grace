# convert hours to seconds:
#convert hours to minutes first, so multiply the amount of hours by 60
#then convert the amount in minutes to seconds by multiplying it by 60


#def how_many_seconds(hours):
    #return hours * 60 * 60

#hours  = int(input("Enter the amount of hours here: "))
#print(how_many_seconds(hours))

#Power Calculator
#def power(voltage, current):
    #power = current * voltage
    #return power
